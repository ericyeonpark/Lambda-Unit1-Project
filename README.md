Does streaming more help gain more followers?

I took a look at some Kaggle data to see if streaming more helps gain more followers.
- Conducted linear regressions, logistic regressions, and multiple regressions on Netflix data using Python to address strategic question regarding which features improve likelihood of movie posting on Netflix
- Analyzed, cleaned, and feature engineered large, complex, Netflix data sets (17,000 lines) to calculate precision, recall, and f1 scores utilizing confusion matrices and ROC curves
- Compared and contrasted a Random Forest and XGBoost model to optimize the accuracy for predictions on test data (accuracy at 82%, surpassing the the baseline by 4%) 
- Created a Ridge Regression model to calculate mean absolute error(MAE) to help visualize what features are most important in determining an IMDb rating
